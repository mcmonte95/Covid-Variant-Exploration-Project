# Project1_Data_BC
Project 1 for Data Analytics Boot Camp

## Covid Variants Exploration
Team Members:
  - Matt Lantin
  - Cole Swartz
  - Michael Chiaramonte
### Project Description:

For our project, we would like to analyze historical SARS-CoV-2 variant data and how different variants are evolving the US over time. We will explore questions such as which variants are the most dominant, compare the dominancy of a specific COVID variant vs COVID death counts, and track how different variants are spreading through the specific Health and Human Services (HHS) regions over time.    

### Repository Guide:
This repository contains 4 main components:
  1. A Jupyter Notebook file called 'COVID_variant_analysis.ipynb' that contains all the raw code used to generate our analysis
  2. A folder called 'Results' which contains both the professional writeup as well as a power point presentation based on our findings
  3. A folder called 'Resources' which contains two folders:
  - A folder called 'Legends' which contains a few screenshots of relevant information to better understand the dataset and project
  - A folder called 'Raw Data' which contains the raw covid death count data used for some of the analysis

### Datasets: 
  1.
  - Name: Weekly estimate of SARS-CoV-2 variant as a proportion of surveillance sequencing
  - Link: https://data.cdc.gov/Laboratory-Surveillance/SARS-CoV-2-Variant-Proportions/jr58-6ysp
  - API: https://data.c
  dc.gov/resource/jr58-6ysp.json
  
  2.
  - Name: Trends in United States COVID-19 Hospitalizations, Deaths, Emergency Department (ED) Visits, and Test Positivity by Geographic Area
  - Link: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_testpositivity_00


### Tasks:
1.	Explore the raw CDC datasets to better understand what it tells us and understand the API documentation
2.	Import the data to python and clean it.
3.	Experiment with different visualizations
4.	Draw conclusions based on the data

### Research Questions:
1. Which are the most dominant COVID variants over the last 3 years?
2.  How are different variants correlated to death count? Can some new COVID mutations actually be a good thing for us?
    - Trend out the different variants over time and compare them to COVID weekly deaths for the United States. 
3.	Are different COVID variants prevalent in different regions? 
    - Compare each regions distribution of variants to each other to see which variants are most prevalent in which region.
4.	How do top variants propagate through regions over time? We can see where in the US they originated and if and how it spread to the rest of the regions. Did the variants originate from a specific region and then how did it spread
