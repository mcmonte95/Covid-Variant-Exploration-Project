Project 1 for Data Analytics Boot Camp

## Covid Variants over Time per HHS Region
Team Members:
  - Matt Lantin
  - Cole Swartz
  - Michael Chiaramonte
### Project Description:

For our project, we would like to analyze historical SARS-CoV-2 variant data and how different variants are propagating through the US over time. We will explore questions such as which variants are most prevalent per region, compare the regions to each other, and track if different variants are spreading through the regions over time.    

### Dataset: 
  - Name: Weekly estimate of SARS-CoV-2 variant as a proportion of surveillance sequencing
  - Link: https://data.cdc.gov/Laboratory-Surveillance/SARS-CoV-2-Variant-Proportions/jr58-6ysp
  - API: https://data.cdc.gov/resource/jr58-6ysp.json

### Research Questions:
1.	Check the different variant distribution through each HHS region over time.
2.	Compare each regions distribution of variants to each other to see which variants are most prevalent in which region.
3.	Check how variants propagate through regions over time. We can see where in the US they originated and if and how it spread to the rest of the regions.  

### Current Tasks:
1.	Explore the raw CDC dataset to better understand what it tells us.
    a.	Understand the API documentation
2.	Import the data to python and clean it.
3.	Experiment with different visualizations
4.	Draw conclusions based on the data
